Java: 11

### Task:

Create a parameterized Numdoc class.

1) Parametrization by numbers only.
2) Stores the value of a number.
3) Implement add, subtract, multiply and divide methods:
     - methods accept any number (wild card).
     - methods return an object of the original type.

If the resulting number does not fit into the type, throw an exception with a message about what and which type did not fit.
